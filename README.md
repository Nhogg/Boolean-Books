# Boolean-Books
This project was my final project for COMP 170 at Loyola Chicago.
Boolean Books is a "full - featured" (about as full - featured as a CLI application can get) library management system. It allows librarians to add media (books, CDs, DVDs) and allows patrons to checkout and return media. It features a content management system and a patron management system, all accessed via a command line interface. Data is stored in a MySQL database.
