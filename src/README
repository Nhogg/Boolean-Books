As I mentioned in the video, you can download mysql and set up a connection to run this.
The steps are as follows:
Download MySQL for your machine (tested on windows, not sure about any other os) from this link:
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

Run the installer
When prompted, select typical install. Just confirm everything until you get to the portion that asks
for a username and password. Leave the username as default and make the password "admin1234"
After that, complete the install as normal.
After it is installed you should have a new application on your machine. Hit the windows key and type mysql.
Open MySQL command line client. It will prompt you for a password, enter "admin1234"
After that, return to the code and run Main.java. If you get an error, it is likely from the JDBC not working properly.

If that is the case, in Intellij, go to project structure > modules and hit the plus. Select JAR and
 navigate to mysql-connector-j-8.30. After that, click the check box to the left and hit apply at the bottom.
 Everything should work fine after that.
